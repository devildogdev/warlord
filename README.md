# Warlord

A spin on the classic 1984 MS-DOS game, [Drug Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Wars_(video_game)) by John E. Dell. In this spin, you play as an international arms dealer instead of a drug dealer.

## Game Intro

You are a small time arms dealer, trying to make a name for yourself. To get you started, you get a little capital from

You have one year (52 weeks) build your fortune. Watch out for law enforcement.
