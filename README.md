### Back Story

You are a small time arms dealer, trying to make a name for yourself. To get you started, you get a little capital from
an *"investor"*. They aren't exactly a Credit Union, so this is going to cost you. Keep an eye on your debt. The interest tacks on each week.
You have one year (52 weeks) build your fortune. Watch out for law enforcement.
